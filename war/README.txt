# Using the Dojo Toolkit for MVC JavaScript applications

This is a repository based on the [Dojo
Boilerplate](https://github.com/rmurphey/dojo-boilerplate/) for demonstrating
simple MVC concepts using the [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org).

This repository is set up to work using a version of Dojo hosted on the Google
CDN. If you'd prefer to use a local version of Dojo -- or if you're interested
in trying out the build script at `util/build.sh` -- you'll need to run the
setup script at `util/setup.sh` to download the full Dojo SDK. You'll also need
to follow the instructions regarding commenting and uncommenting script files
in `www/index.html`.
